function Rank=ks(X)
%+++ Employ the K-S algorithm for selecting the representative samples;
%+++ X: a m x n matrix with m samples and n variables.
%+++ Rank: sample index ordered by the representitiveness. if you want to select for example the most
%+++       representitive 10 samples, select the samples corresponding to
%+++       the first 10 indice in Rank.
