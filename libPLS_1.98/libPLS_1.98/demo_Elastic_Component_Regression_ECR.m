%%%%%%% ECR is a general regression method. It has one supervising       %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%% factor alpha=[0,1]                                               %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%% when alpha=0,   ECR corresponds to PCR                           %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%% when alpha=1,   ECR corresponds to PLS                           %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%% when 0<alpha<1, ECR gives transitional models betwen PCR and PCR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%% How to use this script: just run it line by line and check       %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%% out the results from each line.                                  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
